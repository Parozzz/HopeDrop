When you are creating an item, you can change almost everything of it. 
These are the possible configurable options:  
  - Type of the item  ->  id
    https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html

  - Data/Durability of the item  ->  data

  - Name of the item  ->  name

  - Lore of the item  ->  lore

  - Flags of the item, used to hide certain item value  ->  flag

  - Enchantment of the item  ->  enchant

  - Unbreakable tag (Only for MC1.9+) ->  unbreakable
